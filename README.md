Solus
=====

"The exclusion is not always visible, we can act as a social being but that does not mean we feel interacting with others.

We can not feel it every day, but there are times when all the others around us seem to communicate in strange and incompressible ways, and our presence can even be ignored."

The giberish from the room is heard while one is outside, once inside the room a proximity sensor is triggered and the dolls get quiet leaving one in awkwardness.
